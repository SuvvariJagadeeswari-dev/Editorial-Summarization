"Inconclusive chapter: Tamil Nadu should help prepare its students for clearing NEET. With President Droupadi Murmu withholding assent to the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill 2021, the State faces another setback in its attempt to exempt itself from the NEET-based admission system. CM M.K. Stalin convened a meeting to discuss future steps, as this uncertainty impacts students. The Bill, originally passed in 2021 based on Justice A.K. Rajan Committee recommendations, was returned by the Governor and then re-adopted and sent to the President. The delay in assent leaves students in limbo. NEET has been upheld consistently by courts, and the President is under no obligation to approve the Bill. Despite political consensus in Tamil Nadu, legal options are limited, and a quick judicial resolution is unlikely. The editorial concludes that the State should prepare legally and simultaneously support students in NEET preparation.","President Murmu’s withholding of assent to Tamil Nadu’s anti-NEET Bill prolongs the state’s legal and political struggle. The editorial urges the State to both prepare for a legal battle and simultaneously help students face NEET with confidence, given the uncertain resolution and limited legal options."
"Clean voter lists or the choice of Aadhaar linkage. In its March 30, 2025 issue, The Economist lamented how 'India is obsessed with giving its people unique IDs'. It mocked how various arms of the Indian state announce new unique IDs nearly every month — for everyone from doctors, teachers, athletes, judges, gig workers to even cows and buffaloes. The Economist got it half wrong. India is obsessed with IDs but not 'unique' IDs. There is a profound and fundamental difference between giving an ID (can identify a person specifically for a certain role or function or a group, such as an ID to drive or vote or to perform surgery). A unique ID identifies the individual, regardless of their role or function. It certifies that the person is indeed who they are. India’s confusion between these terms often conflates and ends up converting an 'ID' and a 'unique ID', with some disastrous consequences — as the Election Commission of India (ECI) found out recently. In March of this year, the ECI announced that it was going to ask voters to consent to 'link Voter ID with Aadhaar'. The Voter ID (Electorate Photo Identity Card or EPIC) is an ID for the purposes of voting. Aadhaar is a Unique ID with no voting functional purpose. In simple terms, the ECI wants to convert its ID to a Unique ID. The article uses the 2024 Maharashtra elections to show how suspicious surges in voter registration point to possible fraud and duplication. Similar trends were observed in other states, such as Bengal. The ECI’s solution of linking Aadhaar, while logical in theory, is legally problematic since Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory. The author calls for legal clarity, transparency, and an oath-bound commitment from ECI to ensure truly clean, de-duplicated voter lists.","The article by Praveen Chakravarty critiques the ECI’s initiative to link Voter IDs with Aadhaar. It highlights the critical distinction between IDs and Unique IDs, arguing that Voter IDs are not inherently unique and this confusion leads to duplication and fraud. Using Maharashtra’s 2024 election as an example, the article shows how voter rolls may have been manipulated. It supports Aadhaar linking as a means to de-duplicate voter lists, but stresses that Aadhaar's non-mandatory status under law creates a serious challenge. The author urges a legally binding, transparent system to ensure clean voter rolls, asserting that any guarantee of voter ID uniqueness must be made under oath."
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka (April 4–6), his first after 2019, demonstrated, beyond optics, the close ties between the two countries. Colombo, under the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)-led National People’s Power (NPP) regime, is serious about improving relations with New Delhi. This was evident from the conferment of its highest honour for foreign leaders on Mr. Modi and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on defence cooperation, billed as the first of its kind in bilateral ties. The JVP’s ascension to power, following Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s victory in the presidential poll in September 2024, and the NPP’s resounding parliamentary election victory two months later, gave room to the perception that there would be a strictly formal, if not cold, relationship with India, given the JVP’s anti-India posture of the past. There was also apprehension that Colombo might not be sensitive to New Delhi’s security concerns. However, to be fair to him, Mr. Dissanayake reiterated his country’s long-standing position that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be used against India’s security and regional stability. Mr. Modi captured the rationale behind the MoU by saying that 'the security of both countries is interconnected and co-dependent'. Even though the MoU may have formalised certain arrangements in the area of defence, bilaterally, it is up to the NPP regime to establish that Sri Lanka means business in defence cooperation. But still, Sri Lanka is sure to be conscious that an understanding in 1987 not to let Trincomalee or any other Sri Lankan port be used for military purposes by a third country against India has not helped dispel India’s concerns. On the vexatious fishermen’s issue — one of importance to Tamil Nadu — it was a good sign that there were detailed discussions. But Mr. Modi’s visit should trigger a full-fledged discussion between the fishing communities of the two countries, and one that is overseen by government officials. Recently, fishers on either side of the Palk Bay met and exchanged their views. If this meeting is to have some meaning, it should be followed up with another round of talks. A flexible approach will help create a lasting solution. Another significant outcome of the visit is that Tamil parties, in their meeting with Mr. Modi, conveyed the point that they recognised the significance of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 in pursuit of achieving a political settlement for the Tamils and sought India’s 'legitimate involvement'. There has been criticism even in Sri Lanka that many of the parties had not fully supported the Accord, which paved the way for the establishment of provincial councils as a measure of devolution. New Delhi, which can provide liberal economic aid for the war-torn Northern and Eastern provinces, should play the role of a dispassionate observer and urge every stakeholder to pursue democratic means to arrive at a consensus.","Prime Minister Modi’s April 2025 visit to Sri Lanka strengthened bilateral relations amid the new JVP-led NPP regime. Key outcomes included a defence cooperation MoU and reassurances from President Dissanayake that Sri Lankan territory would not threaten India’s security. Concerns remained over third-party military use of Sri Lankan ports. Discussions on the fishermen’s conflict, critical for Tamil Nadu, were welcomed and should continue. Tamil parties acknowledged the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 and urged India’s involvement in ensuring political settlement for Tamils. The editorial calls for continued dialogue and India’s support for regional stability and democratic consensus."
"In 1934, India’s skies were not its own. Under British colonial rule, the Aircraft Act of 1934 governed aviation in India, a law that was designed not to foster a burgeoning aviation sector but to ensure British control over airspace. Despite India's growing aviation industry, the legal framework has remained stuck in the past. The Bharatiya Vayuayan Adhiniyam, 2024 marks a new era, replacing the 1934 Act and bringing reforms to align India’s aviation with global norms. Yet, one issue remains unaddressed: arbitration. India lacks specialised arbitration systems and infrastructure for aviation disputes. Despite centres like the Delhi International Arbitration Centre and the Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration, Indian aviation disputes are still resolved overseas due to insufficient institutional support and legal expertise. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre handles about 90% of corporate arbitration cases involving Indian entities, showcasing India’s failure to create necessary judicial and executive infrastructure. This procedural and policy failure leads to economic and legal outflows. To reverse this, India needs a specialised arbitration panel, institutional independence, and global credibility. Without urgent reforms, Indian aviation arbitration cases will continue to go abroad.","Despite the Bharatiya Vayuayan Adhiniyam, 2024 marking significant reforms in India’s aviation sector, a major gap remains in specialised arbitration. India still lacks a robust framework and infrastructure for resolving aviation-related disputes, causing most such cases to be handled overseas in places like Singapore and London. The article argues that India must urgently establish a dedicated aviation arbitration ecosystem, ensure judicial and regulatory efficiency, and align with global standards to prevent legal and economic outflows and become a true aviation hub."
"The All India Congress Committee (AICC)/Congress Working Committee session held in Ahmedabad on April 8-9 focused on initiating organisational reforms at the grassroots level and restoring ideological clarity. The choice of Ahmedabad was symbolic due to its association with India’s freedom struggle and the party’s long absence from power in Gujarat. The Congress reaffirmed its commitment to secularism, pluralism, and social justice, with Rahul Gandhi advocating for a caste census and removal of the 50% cap on quotas. The party emphasized district-level leadership and decision-making to counter its high-command culture. However, internal challenges persist: factionalism, centralization, and lack of a clear road map continue to hinder revival efforts. The party must balance power between regional leaders and central authority and focus on youth and middle-class aspirations. While the session marked a step towards renewal, the outcome depends on follow-through and strategic clarity.","The Congress party’s recent Ahmedabad session signaled a push for grassroots reforms and a shift away from its centralized high-command culture. Emphasizing secularism, social justice, and district-level leadership, the party aims to rebuild from the bottom up. However, internal factionalism, a lack of clear strategy, and centralised control remain key hurdles. The session is seen as a starting point, and the party’s future hinges on how well it implements these reforms and connects with the aspirations of the youth and middle class."
"The Beijing India Report on gender-responsive climate-resilient development highlights the critical link between gender equality and climate action. The report emphasizes the disproportionate impact of climate change on women due to existing inequalities in society. It advocates for women's active participation in climate decision-making, access to resources, and ownership of land, recognizing their crucial role in climate adaptation and mitigation. The report underscores the need for gender-responsive policies and programs, including women-led climate initiatives and gender-disaggregated data. It also calls for increased public and private sector investment in gender-inclusive climate solutions, highlighting the importance of partnerships between government, civil society, and the private sector to empower women and build a sustainable future. The report proposes a shift from top-down to bottom-up approaches, enabling communities, particularly women, to drive climate action.","The Beijing India Report emphasizes the intersection of gender equality and climate change, highlighting how climate change disproportionately affects women. It calls for women's increased participation and leadership in climate action, advocating for gender-responsive policies, greater access to resources, and increased investment in women-led climate initiatives. The report stresses the need for collaboration among various sectors to empower women and ensure a sustainable, climate-resilient future."
"The conservation argument for resurrecting dire wolf is not credible. Colossal Biosciences is an American company with an unusual marketing line: combining genomics with conservation, not in its traditional form, but through de-extinction, which is resurrecting extinct species for thousands of years. Leading this project is Harvard geneticist George Church, a prominent promoter of the company, who aims to bring back the woolly mammoth, a distant ancestor of the elephant. The stated logic is to combat global warming. During the Pleistocene ice ages, the mammoth roamed lush grasslands across the tundra. Until its extinction around 4,000 years ago, the Arctic tundra also supported large populations of bison, wolves, cave lions, and giant deer. As the climate warmed, these species disappeared, and the grasslands gave way to shrubbery and sheets of snow. As temperatures rise, permafrost begins to disappear, resulting in high emissions of methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. To prevent this, some scientists at a Siberian park have been transport-ing large animals that are resistant to cold to keep their foraging can restore the grasslands. Grass absorbs less heat than the tall trees in a shrub for-est—the dominant species—and therefore decel-erates warming, but it cannot stop warming, the woolly mammoth, though extinct, is seen as a potent weapon in this climate plan. Scientists at Colossal have extracted fragments of its DNA from fossils and reconstructed its genome. By comparing it to that of the modern elephant, they have edited specific genes to recreate mam-moth-like traits, with the goal of eventually incu-bating a hybrid embryo in an elephant's womb. Scientists have also experimented with the dire wolf, an extinct relative of the gray wolf, and this birthed three snow-white wolves. However, this claim has yet to pass rigorous peer review, and point out that only 20 genes were edited, and what has been created is, in essence, a 'strange-looking gray wolf'. Despite such criticisms, the technological achievement is a testament to the ability to engineer precision edits to the genome. The work of Chinese scientist He Jiankui, who claimed to have produced gene-edited human babies, remains controversial. Colossal may be credited for its genomics work, but the claim that it is reviving species for conservation is not cred-ible. Thousands of living species are vanishing due to habitat loss and human encroachment. Spending millions of dollars on speculative pro-jects, whose benefits, if there are any, will fructify only over centuries, takes away resources from immediate conservation efforts. The scientific community must lay down strict guidelines on the use of gene-editing technology in applica-tions other than health.","Colossal Biosciences, a company combining genomics with conservation, aims to de-extinct species like the woolly mammoth and dire wolf. Their primary argument is to combat global warming by restoring ancient grasslands, which they claim would absorb less heat. While they have successfully extracted and edited DNA to create mammoth-like traits and snow-white wolves, critics question the scientific rigor and conservation benefits. The article argues that these speculative, long-term projects divert resources from immediate conservation efforts for existing species, and calls for strict guidelines on gene-editing technology outside of health applications."
"The National Education Policy proposes to change India's siloed higher education system by establishing large multidisciplinary educational institutions. The emphasis will be on creating a more cross-disciplinary education, a pedagogical shift towards 'communication, discussion, debate, research, and opportunities for cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary thinking', and interdisciplinary research. How can we transform the existing system of universities, colleges, and the research ecosystem in India to achieve these objectives? The answer: a progression from a multidisciplinary campus or university space to a cross-disciplinary collaborative teaching and research practice, interdisciplinary learning, and also research based on integrated disciplinary frameworks. Multidisciplinarity is the existence of multiple disciplines in a single project or programme without seeking interaction. Disciplines exist parallel to each other, with each applying their own disciplinary methods and perspectives and maintaining boundaries. Cross-disciplinary approach expects collaboration between different disciplines without emphasizing knowledge integration. It works towards creating connections and fostering dialogue between disciplines. An example would be an educationist and an economist writing this article. An interdisciplinary approach, on the other hand, integrates insights, methods, and concepts from different disciplines to address complex real-world problems. It goes beyond collaboration, leading to the synthesis of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries. The multidisciplinary campus: Phasing out single stream institutes of higher education (HE) to establish multidisciplinary campuses can work in two ways. First, by adding departments to expand the existing core disciplines of HE – for example, the Indian Institutes of Technology are adding or strengthening their humanities and social sciences, offering integrated masters programmes in economics and allied disciplines. Second, creating university clusters by connecting existing institutions – for example, a commerce college can collaborate with an arts and science college to create a cluster university. This requires administrative streamlining and not just academic collaboration. Clustering single stream institutions might be an effective and time-efficient way of creating large multidisciplinary institutions in the short term. However, according to the 2020-21 All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE), a significant proportion of institutions are under-graduate colleges, 35% of these are single stream, and many of these are only ITI colleges, making it difficult to find appropriate disciplinary variety nearby that is suitable for clustering. In addition to repurposing existing HEIs, new multidisciplinary universities will have to be established to reach the goal of having 'at least one in every district' by 2030. It would be wise to establish a single multidisciplinary campus in a district rather than have one institution with multiple campuses across districts to promote concentrated high research efficiency. Research shows that while public universities have a higher educational efficiency, they have lower research efficiency because they need to manage multiple campuses. Cross-disciplinary learning and practice: The university of the future cannot be just a collection of multiple departments. It needs a disciplinary faculty that is open to collaboration and diverse points of views, and experienced in working across disciplines. To achieve this in the long run, students (i.e. faculty of the university) and current faculty need exposure to different disciplines. This cross-disciplinary approach to learning starts with students taking courses across departments outside their core discipline. The next step is to encourage and facilitate cross disciplinary projects and projects to solve complex problems. At this stage, faculty and students are expected to bring in their disciplinary knowledge, collaborating and fostering dialogue between the disciplines. This can lead to the creation of cross-disciplinary courses – for example, a course titled 'Economic changes and class structures as seen in Indian cinema, in collaboration with the economics, sociology, and film studies faculty'. Incentivising such cross disciplinary courses, project or internship needs additional funding to be able to overcome multiple years. The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program in the United States is a good example of substantial investment in having teachers and researchers of the future with a 'breadth of skills, strengths, and understanding to work in an interdisciplinary environment while being well-grounded with depth of knowledge in a major field'. On inter-disciplinary thought: Cross-disciplinary learning and practice expects collaboration between disciplines. On the other hand, interdisciplinary thinking and research requires drawing deeper connections between disciplines and the creation of integrated frameworks. Can cross-disciplinary research and practice really reach this ideal? In the experience of the writers of this article of the Integrated Graduate Research Traineeship (IGERT), this was achieved in some cross-disciplinary combinations such as biotechnology, neuroscience, chemistry and biology. However, for disciplines such as engineering and architecture, participating students reported challenges in finding publication venues for integrated research, securing and advancing in academic employment, as they did not fit in any particular discipline. Thus, to avoid interdisciplinarity from sliding into traditional practice, there is a need to overhaul funding and the publication ecosystem as well as faculty hiring promotion practices. The complications in establishing these will be enormous and lingered over several years. This will require reprioritising public spending. The governance and regulatory changes to achieve this also need to be carefully thought out. The fact is that we are trying to create a higher education structure that broadly resembles the American system at its zenith, which has organically grown over a century, in one of the most unregulated and competitive environments.","The National Education Policy (NEP) aims to transform India's higher education by establishing multidisciplinary institutions and fostering cross-disciplinary learning and research. The goal is to move beyond existing siloed disciplines towards integrated frameworks and collaborative approaches. This transformation involves phasing out single-stream institutes and creating university clusters or new multidisciplinary universities. While the NEP envisions a more collaborative and interconnected educational system, challenges remain in implementation, particularly regarding funding, publication venues for interdisciplinary research, and faculty hiring practices. The authors suggest that this shift attempts to emulate the American higher education system, which evolved organically over a century in a less regulated environment."
"The Budget session of Parliament was not able for reasons both good and bad. The sittings off the two Houses stretched beyond midnight to clear the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025. The debates reflected the significant di-vergence of opinion on the management of Waqf properties but were held in a convivial atmosph-ere. The Chairs of both Houses were related to preside over a productive session and the ruling BJP was content to find allies strongly on its side, particularly on the Waqf law amendment. Parlia-ment also approved Presidents Rule in Manipur, following debates held past midnight. The Oppo-sition was buoyant that it got to have its say. It had its constituents holding together, and it even at-tracted some fence-sitters on select issues during the session. The BJP not only managed to steer the legislative agenda but also played to the gal-lery to please its political constituents. It was, no-wever, not all good news. Off the floor of Parlia-ment, business advisory committee meetings of the two Houses saw sharp exchanges. In one in-stance, prompting Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar to walk out, the stand-off between the Congress and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, on the Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi, not being given adequate opportunities to speak, remained unresolved. The votes on the Waqf Bill exposed the diffe-rences within the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) as well as the divergence between prospective allies, the AIADMK and the BJP. The BJD's decision not to is-sue a whip riled many within the party, more so considering BJP patriarch Naveen Patnaik's clear stance against the Waqf Bill. One of the reasons for the AIADMK-BJP split in 2025, was the region-al party's fear of losing its minority voter base. The AIADMK voted against the Waqf Bill, under-scoring its reservations about the BJP’s agenda. While the YSRCP, the AIADMK and the BJD showed an eagerness to keep a distance from the BJP, the JD(U) and the TDP ended up in an em-brace of their dominant ally. The merits of the Waqf amendments may be debatable but the gov-ernment's refusal to take the Muslim communi-ty into confidence on an important piece of legis-lation is a classic sign of majoritarianism. Barring a nominated member in the upper House, no Muslim MP supported the amendments. The Waqf debate also highlighted the fact that the rul-ing alliance does not have a single elected member from the community. In Parliament, beyond the veneer of 'efficient outcomes', the session sharpened political and communal polarisation. Discussions should ideally expand the common ground, but this session failed on that count.","The recent Budget session of Parliament, while productive in clearing legislation like the Waqf (Amendment) Bill 2025 and approving President's Rule in Manipur, also highlighted significant political divisions. Despite a generally convivial atmosphere, sharp exchanges occurred off the floor, such as the unresolved issue of Rahul Gandhi's speaking opportunities. Votes on the Waqf Bill exposed fissures within prospective allies like the BJD and AIADMK, with the AIADMK's opposition stemming from concerns about losing minority voter base due to the BJP's agenda. The article criticizes the government for not consulting the Muslim community on the Waqf amendments, viewing it as a sign of majoritarianism given the lack of elected Muslim MPs supporting the changes. Ultimately, the session intensified political and communal polarization rather than fostering common ground."
"India stands at the cusp of economic glory, aspiring to become a $5 trillion economy and a global powerhouse. However, there is a 'silent epidemic' of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that threatens our economic and developmental ambitions. Today, NCDs are the leading cause of death in the country, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all deaths. To secure a healthy and prosperous future, India must urgently embrace a preventive health-care mindset – one that can heal before there is a need to heal. The rising tide of NCDs, their economic toll: Over the past few decades, India has undergone an epidemiological transition. Communicable diseases such as infection have come under control but have been overtaken by NCDs. Chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, chronic lung diseases, and stroke kill an estimated five million to six million Indians each year. What is particularly alarming is that NCDs are affecting India's younger age. India's working-age population is increasingly affected – a disturbing trend when its GDP target relies on the youthful demographic dividend. In fact, 22% of Indians over 30 years are at risk of dying from an NCD before they hit the age of 70. We see this terror in low-income groups, with 30 to 40-year-olds who have heart ailments or in need of dialysis due to diabetic complications. Beyond the human cost, the economic impact of NCDs is staggering due to the resulting loss of productivity and reduced workforce participation. Studies estimate that NCDs may already be costing India around 5%-10% of its GDP. A World Economic Forum (and Harvard School of Public Health) study projected that between 2012 and 2030, NCDs would inflict a loss of around $3.5 trillion-$4 trillion on the Indian economy. Hence, an investment in preventive health care is not an expense but an economic strategy. Prevention is our best insurance policy for sustainable development. The good news is that most NCDs are largely preventable. Sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, tobacco and alcohol use, pollution, and genetic predisposition are some of the key culprits. By modifying these, we can significantly reduce NCD risk. It is estimated that about 80% of premature heart disease, stroke, and diabetes cases can be prevented by addressing lifestyle factors. Today, around 22%-23% of adults are overweight, and there is an urgent need to tackle obesity. We must make physical activity a part of one's daily routine with at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, be it in the form of walking, yoga, or sports. Eat a healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and proteins, and lower in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats is a must. Air pollution is a health emergency directly affecting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and even heart attacks. We must view pollution control as part of preventive medicine. Finally, the most important measure is health early, which means detecting these conditions early, through screening starting at the age of 40 years or earlier if there is family history, can literally be a lifesaver. Early detection means timely intervention, controlling blood pressure before it causes a stroke, or detecting a precancerous polyp before it turns into colon cancer. Screening such as mammograms for breast cancer or HPV tests for cervical cancer can find early, curable stages of disease. Technology can transform prevention: Digital health technology - from smartphone apps and wearables to big data analytics - is a game changer. India has over 800 million smartphone users, which means we have the ability to deliver health advice, reminders, and risk assessments in the palm of everyone's hand. Wearable devices and health trackers allow individuals to keep an eye on their health stats. The information from real-time data into preventive care puts an exclusive new front. Most transformative is the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predictive health modeling. AI algorithms can analyse vast datasets to predict an individual's risk for various NCDs with remarkable accuracy. AI tools can analyse an individual's profile and generate a 'health risk score' that forecasts the likelihood of, say, a cardiac event or developing diabetes over the next decade. AI also helps in early diagnostics – for instance, machine learning models can scan chest X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans to detect early lung nodules or early signs of fatty liver that a human might miss, enabling pre-emptive action. For effective preventive medicine, augmented by AI, should always remain humane, compassionate, and patient-centric. Used responsibly, digital health and AI will be our greatest allies in making preventive care more proactive, precise, and accessible. Fostering a 'preventive mindset': Preventive medicine is not just a set of services but a mindset. I envision a future where every individual, community, corporate and government thinks 'health first' in every action and policy. Individuals become responsible and prioritize their own health. I urge every reader to schedule that check-up you have been postponing and make small daily changes like taking the stairs or walking 30 min to an apartment building and appreciate your well-being. Corporate and policymaking play a pivotal role by investing in employee wellness programs and health checkups in-house counselors and fitness sessions. Health-care providers must pivot from a reactive care model to a preventive care model. The government's role is extremely important and initiatives such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs and the establishment of Health and Wellness Centres with a focus on screening and prevention are stellar steps. Beyond this, public policies should also be health oriented; urban planning should create green spaces for exercise, education curricula should include health and nutrition, and food industry regulations should encourage reduced salt and sugar. In the years that I have striven to make preventive care accessible and impactful, I have seen thousands of lives turned around because a disease was caught early or a risk factor was managed in time. Every individual has the power to make choices that guard their health. And those choices, scaled across a billion Indians, can help define our nation's health and happiness and ensure we reach our economic goals too.","India faces a 'silent epidemic' of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are the leading cause of death and pose a significant economic threat. The article advocates for a shift to a preventive healthcare mindset, emphasizing lifestyle modifications like healthy diet and exercise, pollution control, and early detection through regular screenings. It highlights the transformative potential of digital health technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predictive health modeling and early diagnostics. The author stresses the need for a 'health first' mindset across individuals, communities, and policy-makers, calling for responsible use of technology, government initiatives, and health-oriented public policies to promote a healthier, more productive population and achieve India's economic goals."
"The Delhi High Court recently addressed a suit against Wikimedia Foundation, specifically concerning statements made on Wikipedia pages. The court observed that 'people at large have a tendency to accept statements made on [Wikipedia’s] web pages…as gospel truth'. In a 2024 hearing, the court noted that ANI had filed suit, and sought the identities of volunteers who edited the ANI page, whose anonymity the platform allows to protect them from retaliation. The court emphasized that 'We will close your business transaction here. We will ask the government to block Wikipedia. If you don't like India, please don't work in India.' The Foundation had appealed for its right to safe harbour under the Information Technology Act 2000. The court, however, ruled in favor of the plaintiff, stating that 'statements on the page pertaining to the plaintiff are all sourced from…editorials and opinionated pages'. This raises concerns about the reliability and impartiality of Wikipedia, as it relies on volunteers who may express personal opinions rather than objective facts. The court's decision highlighted a problem with the elements of truth in an open-source platform, where opinions are often mistaken for facts. It also raises questions about accountability when a platform claims neutrality but allows anonymous edits that may reflect bias. The court expressed concern for ANI's credibility, noting that volunteers who edited the ANI page did not adhere to Wikipedia's guidelines. This ruling suggests that the Foundation's ability to maintain a democratic structure that allows Wikipedia to be popular in India is limited by the country's tolerance for certain opinions. The court's ruling will likely influence other collaborative efforts in India, potentially leading to increased scrutiny and regulation of online platforms. The judgment underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in user-generated content, especially when it purports to be factual. It also suggests that the free flow of information on such platforms may need to be balanced with stricter guidelines to ensure accuracy and prevent the spread of misinformation.","The Delhi High Court's ruling against Wikimedia Foundation regarding a suit filed by ANI highlights concerns about the reliability and impartiality of Wikipedia.

"On World Health Day (April 7), as nations reflect on the foundations of human well-being, India stands with a transformative lesson: health and sanitation are not separate chapters, but are two sides of a coin. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has undertaken a sanitation and water revolution that has not only changed the way we live but also how we thrive. Rural missions that made a difference: The story of modern India cannot be told without acknowledging the contribution of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Grameen and the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). These programmes are not just about toilets and tap water alone. They represent a shift in the soul of the nation. These rural missions symbolise dignity, equity, and, above all, health. When the Prime Minister launched the SBM from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2014, he ignited a movement that has touched every Indian household, making it a people’s movement – a Jan Andolan that was anchored in behavioural change and intergenerational equity. By 2019, India had declared itself Open Defecation Free (ODF) and taken significant steps towards achieving SDG 6.2 in its access to safely managed services including drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030 and also ending open defecation, 11 years ahead of time. The SBM has been a powerful public health intervention. A World Health Organization (WHO) report estimated that over three lakh diarrhoeal deaths were averted. The Gates Foundation reported in 2017 that there were 58% higher cases of stunting among children in non ODF areas. A UNICEF study (2017) found that 93% of women felt safer after getting a toilet at home and ODF families saved ₹50,000 annually in healthcare costs, ensuring higher savings. The SBM has improved environmental outcomes. Groundwater contamination in ODF villages is 12.7 times less likely, ensuring long-term health resilience in rural communities. A (2024) Nature study estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 child deaths are prevented every year due to improved sanitation access. These outcomes are not incidental, they are the result of sustained political commitment, inter-ministerial coordination, and community ownership. By 2019, the Jal Jeevan Mission was launched to ensure every rural household receives clean drinking water through a tap connection. This is more than infrastructure; it is an investment in human potential and in achieving socio-economic impact. Research by Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Kremer has shown that nearly 30% infant deaths can be averted when water is made available to families through drinking and 1.36 lakh child deaths (under five years) can be prevented with universal tap coverage. WHO estimates suggest that the JJM could avert four lakh diarrhoeal deaths with safe drinking water supply at home. And, 5.5 crore hours are saved every day, mostly by women, who had earlier spent time fetching water. State Bank of India research findings that the availability of safe liquid increases to 39,000 in women’s participation by women in agriculture and allied activities. The Sujal and Swachh Gaon campaign, launched in integrate water, sanitation, and hygiene at the village level, has helped advanced communities. Thousands of villages have already been declared Swachh Sujal, which is an important marker of holistic public health transformation, improved safe sanitation and systems, also leading to a rollout of pocket-sized infrastructure in rural households, reinforcing the preventive health-care model. On the ground: Sanitation and water are the first line of defence. Public health. They are the invisible shield that protects communities from disease, women from indignity, and children from lost opportunity. A healthy nation is a productive nation. A clean nation is a resilient one. Today, more than 80% of India’s rural households have tap water connections. Over 96% villages have been declared as ODF Plus, more than 5.07 lakh villages have solid waste management systems, and 5.23 lakh villages have liquid waste management systems in place. Women are not just beneficiaries, they are also water testers, sanitation entrepreneurs, and local leaders. Over 2.45 million women have been trained to test water quality, and women-led Self Help Groups are managing sanitation assets, recycling centres, and even sanitary napkin production. This is the story of Bharat, a place where no child misses school because of a lack of water, no woman walks miles with a pot on her head, and no family loses a loved one to preventable illness. The biggest health is the journey to dignity, a toilet brings privacy. Clean water brings opportunity. Waste management protects the environment. Each link in the sanitation chain contributes directly to a healthier, safer India. The lessons we have learnt highlight the importance of inter-ministerial collaboration which is non-negotiable. It is about convergence: Since, health is not the concern of one Ministry alone, it is the outcome of converged action across water, sanitation, nutrition, education, and rural development. We must recognise that it’s not magic; it’s not insular, it is global. Our innovations, community-led models, and use of technology whether through real-time dashboards, Geo-tagging or Agri-geo Agri-Research from (or to bio-digesters) biogas plants to plastic waste management units are blueprints for the world, especially the Global South. Lastly, we must continue to work through a mutual understanding that every rupee invested in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) yields manifold returns in health, productivity, gender equity, and environmental sustainability. India is committed towards progressing forward on the United Nations Sustainable Development goals and the World Health Day, which acknowledge and remember that good health begins not in hospitals, but in homes with access to clean water, safe sanitation, and a shared resolve. As we move forward, India remains committed to sharing its journey, collaborating globally, and co-creating a cleaner, healthier, and more resilient world.","India has achieved a transformative shift in health and sanitation through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Grameen and Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). These initiatives have led to India being declared Open Defecation Free (ODF), significant reductions in diarrhoeal deaths, improved child health, and enhanced safety and savings for women. The success is attributed to sustained political commitment and community ownership. The JJM has provided tap water connections to over 80% of rural households, preventing millions of illnesses and saving women countless hours. Women are also actively involved in water testing and managing sanitation assets. The article emphasizes that health is a result of converged action across multiple ministries and that India’s innovative models are blueprints for the world. Ultimately, investments in Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) yield significant returns in health, productivity, gender equity, and environmental sustainability, reflecting India's commitment to global sustainable development goals."
